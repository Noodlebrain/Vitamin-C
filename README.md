# Vitamin-C
Discord bot that provides information for the game "100% Orange Juice!"

# Current features of this bot
This bot allows you to look up 100% Orange Juice cards by putting the cards you are looking for in between [] square brackets.
This is case insensitive, and it supports looking up characters, their hypers, enemies, and deck cards.
**Using this feature requires you to mention (@) the bot.**

A character's hyper can be fetched by either typing the name of the card, or typing the name of a character followed by ".hyper" (i.e. [qp.hyper]).

The fetching of cards will work even when there is other text in your message, so you can say something like  
"You know, [Suguri] is a high risk character",  
and it will show Suguri's character card.

Mentioning multiple cards in a single message will also work: the bot will fetch information about each one in order.  
(i.e. "[Kai] just defeated [QP] and was going to win, but his home was rigged with Saki's [Big Bang Bell].")

C!playofthegods (or C!potg) fetches a random Event card. (Yes, this isn't how Play of the Gods works in-game, but it's kinda close, right?)

C!extention (or C!ext) fetches a random Battle card, as if you had played the card Extension.

C!saltybet allows you to run a simulated battle between randomly selected characters (currently only supports the starting 4 characters).

***More features and functionality to come in the future.***
